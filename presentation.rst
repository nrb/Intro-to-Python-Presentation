History of Python
=================
Developed by Guido von Rossum in 1989 at CWI
	 * CWI is a research institution funded by the Dutch government
	 * Guido needed something that was faster for development than C, less tied to Unix then Perl and bash.

Who uses Python?
================
	* Google (Guido works there)
	* DemonWare (Call of Duty servers)
	* CCP Games (EVE Online)
	* CRC (web development, scientific libraries)
	* Dropbox
	* Canonical (creators of Ubuntu)

What is Python?
===============

A dynamically typed, interpreted, general purpose programming language
Open source, BSD-like license
Supported on lots of platforms

General Purpose
===============

Used for lots of different programming tasks
	* Automatic repetitive administrative tasks
	* Scientific calculations (libraries like SciPy and NumPy)
	* Web development (Django, Pyramid, Flask, Google App Engine, so on and so forth)
	
Interpreted
===========

Python code is translated to machine code at runtime, not in a prior compilation step.

Several interpreters
	* Standard CPython
	* PyPy project
	* Stackless

Dynamically Typed
=================
Languages like Chapel, C, Java require variables to have their type declared on creation
Python does not; a variable can hold any kind of value.

Examples:

	a = "a string"
	a = 1

Dynamically Typed
=================
Variable's ~~properties~~ are important, not it's data type.

Also known as "duck typing".
	"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck".


Running Python
==============
From your shell prompt, type:
	$ python
