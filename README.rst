This repo holds the files for a presentation I gave for Notre Dame Summer Scholars 2011.

The bulk of the content is in presentation.rst.

The final slide output, using s5, is in presentation.html, which uses the accompanying ui directory to function properly.

Output can be rendered with sphinx, using the Makefile, or docutils using rst2s5.py
